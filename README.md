CAUTC is a command-line tool designed for analyzing the content size and response time of URLs. It supports multiple content size units, processes files with lists of URLs, and optionally saves results to a file.

## üåü Features

- Content size analysis: Measure the size of content in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or characters.
- Concurrent processing: Fast and efficient processing of multiple URLs.
- Error handling: Gracefully handle invalid or unreachable URLs.
- File integration: Read URLs from a file and save results to a new file.
- Customizable output: Choose size units for processing (bytes, KB, MB, or characters).

./cautc.exe --path=<file-path> --size=<unit> --save=<true/false>
```

### Arguments

| Argument     | Required | Default   | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--path`     | Yes      |           | Path to the file containing URLs (relative or absolute).                   |
| `--size`     | No       | `bytes`   | Unit of content size measurement (`bytes`, `kb`, `mb`, or `chars`).        |
| `--save`     | No       | `false`   | Save results to a file in the same directory as the input file (`true`).   |

## üõ†Ô∏è Examples

### Basic Execution

To process a file containing URLs, run:  
```bash
./cautc.exe --path=urls.txt
```

### Custom Size Unit

To measure content size in kilobytes, use the following:  
```bash
./cautc.exe --path=urls.txt --size=kb
````

### Save Results to a File

To save results to a file while processing content size in characters:  
```bash
./cautc.exe --path=urls.txt --size=chars --save=true
```

## üìÑ Output Example

### Console Output

Example output printed to the console:  

URL: https://example.com - Size: 150 KB - Time: 234ms  
URL: https://another-site.org - Error downloading content  
URL: https://valid-site.net - Size: 1.2 MB - Time: 1.3s

### File Output

When saving to results.txt, the output might look like this:  
https://example.com - 150 KB - 234ms  
https://another-site.org - Error downloading content - 0ms  
https://valid-site.net - 1.2 MB - 1.3s

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- main.go: Entry point for the application.
- site_processor.go: Core logic for processing and analyzing URLs.
- link_processor.go: Handles file reading and URL extraction.
- sites.txt: Example input file.
